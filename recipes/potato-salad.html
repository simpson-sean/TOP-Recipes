    <h3>Classic Potato Salad just like someone's mom used to make, probably...</h3>
        <p>
            Potato salad is a dish made from boiled potatoes and a variety of other ingredients. It is generally considered a side dish, as it usually accompanies the main course. Potato salad is widely believed to have originated in Germany, spreading largely throughout Europe, European colonies and later Asia.

            American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century.[2][1] American-style potato salad is served cold or at room temperature. Ingredients often include mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-like substitute (such as yogurt or sour cream), herbs, and vegetables (such as onion and celery).[3] Asian-style potato salad is similar to American-style potato salad, but has a sweeter and eggier flavor.
